# Pepperoni Tony's

#### By Anthony DiFalco

#### Webpage for food orders from a sketchy Italian restaraunt

## Technologies Used

* Javascript
* JQuery
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap

## Description

This project is only one html file. On the webpage, there are three forms:
1. Ordering pre-made pizzas
2. Custom ordering pizzas
3. Including sides and beverages

The first form gives 4 options for specialty pizzas, which are described in the menu at the top of the page. Each of these has preset values and you can only select one at a time, since the form uses radio buttons.

The second form allows you to select any numnber of seven different toppings, and one of five sizes. the toppings are priced by quantity and the first two are free. each size has a basic cost to it.

The third form has checkboxes for three sides and three beverage options. any number of these can be selected but to order multiple items you have to submit the form more than once.

Every time a form is submitted, the order field at the bottom of the page updates with item names, prices, and quantity. It tallies the order total at the bottom. Currently the "complete order" button does nothing, but seeing as this is a mock website, all it could really do is steal your credit card information.
